   2. Critical: Replace fake mining algorithm with real RandomX and Cuckoo implementation
   3. Important: Decide on Lightning Network implementation or remove claims
   4. Essential: Verify actual security properties vs claimed properties

  The core quantum-safe cryptography (Kyber + Dilithium) is present in the codebase, but there are critical
  bugs that prevent compilation and many claimed features like advanced mining and Lightning Network are not
  actually implemented.

  Next Steps

   1. Immediate priority: Fix the KYBER_QINV bug in Kyber implementation
   2. Critical: Replace fake mining algorithm with real RandomX and Cuckoo implementation
   3. Important: Decide on Lightning Network implementation or remove claims
   4. Essential: Verify actual security properties vs claimed properties

  The core quantum-safe cryptography (Kyber + Dilithium) is present in the codebase, but there are critical
  bugs that prevent compilation and many claimed features like advanced mining and Lightning Network are not
  actually implemented.

 Key Findings:
   1. Quantum-Safe Foundation: The base implementations of Kyber1024 and Dilithium3 exist but have critical bugs
      (e.g., missing KYBER_QINV constant)

   2. Non-functional Mining: The claimed quantum-resistant mining algorithm is not actually implemented - it's a
      simulation using basic SHA3-512

   3. Mock Features: Several features like Lightning Network are just mock implementations with no real
      functionality

   4. Incomplete Transition: The transition from BTC to QTC is incomplete with many legacy components still
      present

  Production Readiness:
  The QTC codebase is NOT production-ready. Critical fixes are needed before deployment, particularly fixing
  the compilation errors in Kyber implementation and completing the quantum-safe mining algorithm.

  Recommendation:
  Focus on completing core quantum-safe functionality (Kyber/Dilithium implementation, proper mining algorithm)
  before adding complex features like Lightning Network. The project has a solid foundation but needs completion
   of critical components before production use.
